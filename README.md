# Drawable Box Exercise 
Draw a box on your screen with a div. Note that this currently only works in one direction - to the right and down. A more difficult variation of this challenge is being able to draw in any direction (behind your starting point, above your starting point).

To accomplish the mirrored versions, we can use a variety of transforms as needed (css attribute, controlled by React state, use 'initial' if no transformation).
